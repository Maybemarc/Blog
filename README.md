Built a scalable full-stack blog platform where users can securely create accounts, manage blog posts, and interact with public content. The platform allows users to create, read, update, and delete their own blogs while viewing posts created by others.

Key Features:
Implemented user authentication using JWT and cookie-based login for secure session management. Passwords are encrypted with bcrypt to ensure data security. Developed full CRUD functionalities for blog posts, with protected routes using custom authentication middleware. The frontend is built with React.js to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience, while the backend APIs are developed using Node.js and Express.js. PostgreSQL is used for reliable and efficient database management.

Impact:
Designed for security, scalability, and seamless user experience to meet real-world application standards.

Deployment:
The backend is deployed on Vercel with integration to the Neon cloud database, while the frontend is also hosted on Vercel to ensure high availability and global performance.

Tech Stack:
